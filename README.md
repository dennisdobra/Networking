# Networking Projects

This repository contains two networking projects, each focusing on different aspects of networking functionality. Below is a brief description of each project:

## 1. Router-Dataplane

The **Router-Dataplane** project focuses on the implementation of a router's data plane, responsible for processing and forwarding packets. It includes:

- **Packet Forwarding**: Handles the forwarding of IP packets based on a routing table.
- **Routing Protocols**: Integrates basic routing protocols to maintain up-to-date routing information.
- **Error Handling**: Manages incorrect or invalid packets efficiently.

## 2. TCP-UDP-Messaging-Service

The **TCP-UDP-Messaging-Service** project implements a messaging service using both TCP and UDP protocols. Key features include:

- **TCP Support**: Reliable message delivery between clients using the Transmission Control Protocol.
- **UDP Support**: Fast message delivery with the User Datagram Protocol, optimized for speed over reliability.
- **Concurrent Connections**: Allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously and exchange messages.
